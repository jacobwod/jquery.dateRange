h1. [DEPRECATED] - jquery.dateRange

h2. About

dateRange is a simple, jQuery-based date range picker. Sure, you can find tons of great date pickers out there, but personally, I couldn't find anything that had *everything* I needed for my projects. So I used "Karl Seguin's":https://github.com/karlseguin "work":https://github.com/karlseguin/jquery.dateRange as a base, and started adding some modifications.

N.B. This is still _work in progress_, and I'm not dealing with the looks of this plugin for now whatsoever, so don't expect it to look fantastic just yet!

h2. Requirements

jQuery (tested with 1.6.1)

h2. Compatibility

I run some quick tests in the following browsers:

* IE6/7/8/9 (although IE6 support is unintended)
* Firefox 4
* Safari 5
